# code-challenge
Hello World setup for handling interview code challenges

Uses a really simple browser-sync server that watches for changes to files and reloads the page.

There's an example test harness ready to go which allows you to specify test data and the expected outcome for each case. The page shows the outcomes of each test and displays a total of how many passed or failed.

Requires npm.

## Setup

1. `npm i -g browser-sync`

## Run locally

1. `./serve.sh`
1. Go to http://localhost:9000
